DOCKER file creation notes

I have set some default depndencies on my environment but If I make my pipeline script more complex  I might need to add more!. 

What These Do

    SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
        Changes the default shell inside the container to Bash instead of /bin/sh (which is often the default).
        Ensures that subsequent RUN commands in the Dockerfile execute using Bash syntax.
        Useful when working with Conda/Mamba environments since conda activate works better with Bash.

    CMD ["/bin/bash"]
        Defines the default command that runs when the container starts.
        Opens an interactive Bash shell when you run the container (docker run -it your-image).
        If overridden with a different command (docker run your-image echo "Hello"), it won't run /bin/bash. 

✅ Use SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"] if:

    You need to use Bash syntax in RUN commands.
    You're working with Conda, as conda activate works better in Bash.

✅ Use CMD ["/bin/bash"] if:

    You want to drop into an interactive Bash shell when starting the container.

 Next step is to start writing my one script that has it all.
