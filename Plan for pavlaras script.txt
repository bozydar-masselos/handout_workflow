Plan
I need to understand how to handle folder creation and access. 

~whatever was script variable should turn to LOCAL variable
~folder names should become environment variables.


1)one function reads the url from config.yaml

2)one function downloads and unzips the data--->> I will write the part that unzips the data, but the part that downloads no because it will take too long to run. 

3a) One function makes sure that the needed data exist.	done
3b) one function splits exon mutli-spe alignments into exon-single-spe fasta files (core of hndt1.sh ) done

4a)One function that checks there are enough files for the 4b to work. done
4b)A function to concatenate all the exons of a gene of each species into one file (gooe.sh) done

5b)Write the function that will concatenate the complete genes and create the multifasta alignment(script: mltgn.sh) --> done

All the functions will run through a main script. done 



main FUNCTION 		done
-should contain all input arguments which are: 
1) place of yaml file / place of my data  done
2) no_of exons to process. 	done



add final directory name to config 	done
add timestamps at directorynames		!!!
add number of species per alignment on the config file. done
